Here’s a structured reflection template you can use to capture your thoughts:  

---

### **1. Most Important Takeaway**  
*Example:*  
"The course reinforced that **empathy is the backbone of design thinking**. Understanding user needs deeply—not just superficially—leads to breakthrough solutions. The 'Define the unmet need' step was particularly eye-opening."  

*(Replace with your key insight.)*  

---

### **2. Application to Work/Life**  
*Example:*  
- **At work:** Use customer-centric brainstorming to generate ideas in team meetings, ensuring all voices are heard.  
- **Personal projects:** Prototype early (e.g., sketch app wireframes) to test assumptions before overinvesting time.  
- **Leadership:** Encourage a culture where failure is framed as learning during innovation sprints.  

*(Tailor to your context.)*  

---

### **3. One Change to Implement**  
*Example:*  
"**Ask ‘Why?’ five times** to uncover root problems before jumping to solutions—a simple but powerful reframing tool from the course."  

*(Choose a specific action.)*  

---

### **4. Connection to Prior Knowledge**  
*Example:*  
- **Alignment:** Confirms the Agile principle of iterative testing but adds *empathy tools* (e.g., customer journey mapping).  
- **New Insight:** "Welcoming uncertainty" contrasts with my instinct to seek quick fixes—now I’ll pause to explore ambiguity.  

*(Compare and contrast with your experience.)*

**Hashtags** (Optional):  
#DesignThinking #Innovation #UserCentric #ProblemSolving  

*(Add your reflections, then edit or expand as needed!)*
