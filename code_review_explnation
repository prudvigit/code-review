1. Loop Through Input Data & Extract Key Fields
Iterates over each row in the dynamically assigned internal table <lt_result>.
Extracts Material Number (MATNR), Sales Organization (VKORG), and Customer Number (KUNNR) from each row.
Stores them in a structured table lt_data for later use in database queries.

2. Fetch Configuration Value (FSI Plant)
Calls a utility method to retrieve a configuration value (likely a plant code) from table TVARVC.
Stores the value in lv_fsi_plant for filtering in subsequent DB queries.

3. Database Queries to Enrich Data
a. Fetch Planning Strategy Group (MARC)
Retrieves the Planning Strategy Group (STRGR) for each material in lt_data from table MARC.
Filters by the configured FSI plant (lv_fsi_plant).
b. Fetch Sales Data (MVKE)
Fetches Minimum Order Quantity (AUMNG) for each material and sales org from MVKE.
Filters by distribution channel (lc_10, likely hardcoded to '10').
c. Fetch Customer-Material Info (KNMT)
Retrieves Customer-Specific Material Number (KDMAT) from KNMT.
Filters by sales org, distribution channel, customer, and material.

4. Update Original Table with Enriched Data
Loops through the original table again to update it with the fetched data.
a. Update Planning Strategy Group (STRGR)
Maps the Planning Strategy Group from MARC to a field (STRGR1) in the original table.
b. Update Minimum Order Quantity (AUMNG)
Updates the Minimum Order Quantity from MVKE.
c. Update Customer Material Number (KDMAT)
Updates the Customer-Specific Material Number from KNMT.
